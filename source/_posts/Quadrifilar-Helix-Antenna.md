I followed Andrew McNeil's Quadrifilar Helix Antenna design
for 5.8GHz to replace a crappy omni whip antenna that came
with an RC852 Video Rx.

I ordered some semi rigid coax from ChinaRF on eBay. I used
some earth wire from some scrap 2C+E i had laying around. I
tried to straighten it as best i could!

Bending the shape of the lobes was harder than expected. I
post on reddit and someone suggested using a 3D Printer to
create a jig. One for the future i think!

It works better than expected. I hooked it up to my HackRF
and compared the received signal from my FPV racing quad.
With the original omni i was seeing peaks at -65dbm but with
this i reliably get to -55dbm in the same test condition and
subjectively much better signal when the quad is moved around.
