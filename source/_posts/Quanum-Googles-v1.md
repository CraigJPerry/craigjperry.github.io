Hobby king were doing a deal on Quanum v1 headsets. I figured i could repurpose the
screen if i didn't like them.

I'm pleased to say they worked out really cheaply!

* 20GBP Quanum v1 from Hobby King
* 12GBP RC832 5.8GHz Video Rx from Bang Good
* 2GBP GoPro headstrap from eBay

To make this setup, I drilled 2 holes in the back of the Quanum screen's rear case
then bolted the RC832 5.8GHz video receiver to it. I moulded a little epoxy putty
around them to make it look like this is the way the product was designed all along.
Instead of the very poor head strap supplied with the Quanums, I used a GoPro head
mount. I eliminated all the cabling except for a short power cord.

This setup leaves AV Out 1 for another external feed, perhaps a DVR. The monitor
has a second video input but i can't think of any use for that so i didn't expose it.

The Quanum v1 + video Rx is pretty light, but putting the battery behind my head
enhanced the comfort by balancing everything perfectly on my head. I used the gopro
mount to hold the battery by looping an elastic band under the lipo.

The supplied antenna is quite poor, as to be expected. I made a Quadrifilar
helix antenna to replace it. I'll write that up next.
